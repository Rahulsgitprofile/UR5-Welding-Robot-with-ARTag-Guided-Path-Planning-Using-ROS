## üöÄ Project Overview

This project develops a **ROS Noetic** based welding application for the **Universal Robots UR5** arm. It integrates camera-based **AR Tag tracking** to teach a 2D welding trajectory, which is executed with **MoveIt motion planning**. The system ensures safety with collision avoidance, uses TF2 for coordinate transformations, and supports both simulation and real-robot deployment.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Use AR tags for *point-wise teaching* of welding paths via camera pose estimation
- Plan and execute welding trajectories on the UR5 robot using MoveIt
- Ensure safe robot operation with collision avoidance and environment modeling
- Modular, reusable ROS nodes with launch files supporting simulation and real hardware

---

## üß© Features

- Real-time video feed integration using the `usb_cam` package
- AR Tag pose estimation with `ar_track_alvar`
- Custom teaching node to capture and transform poses into TCP frame
- MoveIt-based trajectory planning and execution via action server
- Collision objects added to MoveIt planning scene to avoid environment collisions
- Dynamic launch file arguments for flexible deployment
- Visualization in RViz for path planning and debugging

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Notes
Always verify planned paths in RViz before execution.

Maintain emergency stop button accessibility.

Lower velocity and acceleration parameters when starting with real hardware.

Keep workspace clear to avoid collisions.
